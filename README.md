## Project Introduction ðŸš€
The **Interactive Online Quiz and Exam System (IOQES)** is designed to facilitate the creation, management, and administration of quizzes in educational and organizational settings. It provides robust features for both administrators and users to interact with quiz content efficiently and effectively. The purpose of IOQES is to streamline the process of conducting quizzes, making it easier for educators, trainers, and organizations to administer assessments, evaluate knowledge, and provide immediate feedback. The objectives include enhancing user engagement, ensuring secure access and data management, and supporting sustainable educational practices.

## Objectives ðŸ’¡
- Provide an interactive platform for administering and taking quizzes.
- Allow administrators to manage quiz questions and view results.
- Enable users to take quizzes and view their scores.
- Ensure secure login and authentication for both users and administrators.

## Project Description ðŸ‘¾

### Scope
IOQES enables administrators to create and manage quizzes, including adding, editing, and deleting questions. Administrators can also manage user accounts, view detailed results by user or quiz, and generate comprehensive reports. Users can take quizzes, view immediate feedback on their answers, and track their historical scores over time.

### Limitations and Constraints
- **Concurrent Access**: While the system allows multiple administrators and users, it may face limitations in handling a large number of simultaneous quiz sessions and administrative actions efficiently.
- **User Role Management**: The current implementation does not include advanced role-based access control beyond basic administrator and user roles.
- **Question Types**: The system is designed to handle only text-based and multiple-choice questions, without support for other types of questions or interactive elements.
- **Data Persistence**: The current implementation does not use a database system like SQLite for data persistence, relying on in-memory storage, which means data will not persist between program executions.

### Features
- **Admin Section**:
   - Add, edit, or delete quiz questions.
   - Manage user accounts and reset passwords.
   - View detailed quiz results by user or quiz.
   - Generate comprehensive reports on quiz results.
- **User Section**:
   - Take quizzes and receive immediate feedback.
   - View personal scores and track historical performance.
- **Security**:
   - Secure login system with password encryption for both administrators and users.
- **Reporting**:
   - Generate and review detailed reports on quiz results for both administrative analysis and evaluation.
